What is Unix?

The Unix operating system is a set of programs that act as a link between the computer and the user.

The computer programs that allocate the system resources and coordinate all the details of the computer's internals is called the operating system or the kernel.

Users communicate with the kernel through a program known as the shell
The shell is a command line interpreter; it translates commands entered by the user and converts them into a language that is understood by the kernel.

ï‚· Kernel: The kernel is the heart of the operating system. It interacts with the hardware
and most of the tasks like memory management, task scheduling and file
management.


Unix environment.
An important Unix
concept is the environment, which is defined by environment variables. Some are set by the
system, others by you, yet others by the shell, or any program that loads another program.
A variable is a character string to which we assign a value. The value assigned could be a
number, text, filename, device, or any other type of data.


To display the values of environment variables, use the printenv command. If you specify the Name parameter, the system only prints the value associated with the variable you requested.
